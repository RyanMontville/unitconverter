# unitconverter
In 2023 I wanted to learn C# to see how it compared to Java. After learning the basics I created this unit converter app. It uses Blazor as the web interface.

Click <a href="https://ryanmontville.github.io/unitconverter/">here</a> to run the app.

The program can currently convert:
* An imperial unit to another imperial unit such as feet to yards
* A metric unit to another metric unit such as Kilometer to centimeter
* An imperial unit to a metric unit such as feet to meter
* A metric unit to an imperial unit such as millimeter to feet
* Fahrenheit to celsius
* Celsius to fahrenheit

The app also shows a history of the past conversions.
